# Architecture

<div style="center"><img src="../images/plugin_manager.png" alt="diagram on how plugin manager is integrated with the user application"/></div>

The AWS Advanced NodeJS Wrapper contains 5 main components:

1. The AwsClient classes, such as AwsPgClient, and the AwsPoolClient classes such as AwsMysqlPoolClient.
2. The [plugin manager](./PluginManager.md).
3. The [loadable and extensible plugins](./LoadablePlugins.md).
4. The [plugin service](./PluginService.md).
5. The host list providers.

The wrapper classes ensures all database method calls are redirected to be handled by the connection plugin manager.

The connection plugin manager handles all the loaded or registered plugins and sends the database method call to be executed by all plugins [**subscribed**](./LoadablePlugins.md#subscribed-methods) to that method.

During execution, plugins may utilize the plugin service to help its execution by retrieving or updating:

- the current connection
- the hosts information or topology of the database

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Each client has its own instances of:
>   - plugin manager
>   - plugin service
>   - loaded plugin classes
> - Multiple clients opened to the same database server will have separate sets of instances mentioned above.
> - All plugins share the same instance of plugin service and the same instance of host list provider.
